I started by thinking about how I can solve the task and which language I will use.
Than I wrote down the information to develop a formula for the christmas tree.
After that I started programming.
In the meanwhile I looked up some of my old programmes for reference.
After the main structer for the christmas tree was finished I deleted redundant lines 
and overall cleaned the code up.
